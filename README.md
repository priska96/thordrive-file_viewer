# Getting Started with ThorDrive File Viewer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

If npm, nodeJS and the required dev-dependency are installed you should be 
able to run the program on localhost by using 'npm start'.

If the local server should not work you can run the program in this CodeSandbox as well:
